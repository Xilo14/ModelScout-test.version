# ModelScout

This projects uses https://github.com/MajMcCloud/TelegramBotFramework

# Description

The system of searching for people (potential models) in social networks and further automatic processing.

P.S. I use the source code TelegramBotBase because I needed a feature that is not yet available in the release version.
