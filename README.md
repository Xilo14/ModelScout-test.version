This is pet project for learning TelegramBotBase, EF Core, VkNet and TgBotApi.
In this projects uses GOD objects and other techniques of poor-quality architecture.

I develop this project for help my gf with her work and learning some frameworks which newest for me. 
I also want to get more practice in architecture development.

P.S. I use the source code TelegramBotBase because I needed a feature that is not yet available in the release version.
